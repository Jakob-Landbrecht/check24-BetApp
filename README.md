## Architectual Design desicions
Before starting with the development of the application, there are numerous functional as well as non-functional requirements for the planned software. The most important in this case is the real-time capability in combination with handling over 10.000 online users and 2 million active participants. The European championship is a truly global event. Therefore, the frontend should be accessible to as many people as possible.  
### Backend
My first instinct was to use an AWS DynamoDB instance paired with the Amazon API Gateway which also offers WebSocket capability and running other background tasks in AWS Lambda. Although this would have been a suitable approach, ended up using Google Cloud services.
#### Deployment 
There are several aspects to consider when choosing a deployment option. A bare-metal deployment would not make sense, as the tournament will result in distinct usage peaks that can not be probably handled by one machine. Eventhough, containers in combination with a microservice architecture could be used, I opted for a serverless architecture. More specifically I used Google Cloud functions. These offer the benefit, that all scaling, shrinking, and network management is handled by Google, resulting in a very developer-friendly and scalable experience. Considering the EM's timespan of one month, this is also a very budget-friendly option, as one only pays what one uses. The cloud functions are used for tasks such as updating the rankings in all communities, importing games, and creating snapshots at midnight for visualizing deltas.
#### WebSocket
What is the best way to have 10.000 open WebSocket connections? I spend hours researching this question. Even the Amazon API Gateway has a limitation of 500 new connections a minute, which could be easily reached at the start of a game. The perfect solution for applications with many real-time clients directly requesting user data is Firestore, which I will describe in more detail in the next chapter.
#### Database
Firestore is a product by Google as part of the Firebase offering. It offers specific SDK's for the predominant platforms that solve issues like offline data handling and makes querying data easy. Moreover, it automatically scales so-called "subscription Handler" services that notify the frontend of database changes (think of a scored goal). This way up to 1 million connections can be established. This makes near real-time Access to the leaderboard possible and is perfect for this application. One drawback I noticed is the limited options when building complex queries in contrast to SQL. Sadly queries can only span over one collection (like a folder) which makes compounded requests very complicated and slow.

### Frontend
The frontend is written in Flutter (or Dart to be precise). This cross-platform framework can be used to write iOS, Android, and web applications from one code base. As this App does not tend to be completely production ready there are numerous aspects of my app, that still could be improved. First of all, there is currently no multi-language support and some aspects of error handling are not implemented. The app is structured in models (defining the data structure), screens (views), and services. **If you want check out and play around with the web version of my application on:** [bet.jakob-landbrecht.com](https://bet.jakob-landbrecht.com)

## Features and Fulfilled Requirements
1. Authentication: Firebase Authentication is used to authenticate the user. This way other authentication providers such as Google, Apple, or Facebook could be easily added.
2. Communities: The app can handle multiple tournaments simultaneously and the app can switch between the different tournaments. Every user can create (or join) tournaments and send an invitation code to his friends.
3. Leaderboards: The leaderboard provides the option to search for a specific user and to filter. The total delay from changing the score count until the reordering of the scores on the client device is typically below 2 seconds
4. Betting: Betting is simple. On the Dashboard, you can always see the upcoming games including other useful information (For this I wrote a cloud function that parses a publically available JSON with all games and creates the database entries automatically. Furthermore, I host all country flags of the world on a Cloud storage bucket, to show the country flags). From there one can easily create a bet.
5. Real-time updates: The total delay is under 2 seconds. Cloud Functions sometimes suffer from "cold starting" problems if they are not invoked enough. After the first initial invocation, the delay sinks close to one second, which is not noticeable to the user. As a future improvement, one could build an admin UI to change scores more easily. The current process involves changing the entry in the provided Firebase website.
6. Dashboard: The dashboard shows the current life game and the next upcoming game. Additionally, it shows the required previews of the communities the player is part of.
7. Pinning friends: Pinned friends are **not** stored in the cloud but via a plugin called "shared_preferences" which handles offline storing for the different operating systems.
## Understanding the code
There are two important folders. The first one is [functions](https://github.com/Jakob-Landbrecht/check24-BetApp/tree/main/functions) which stores all serverless functions deployed to Google. The second one is [lib](https://github.com/Jakob-Landbrecht/check24-BetApp/tree/main/betapp/lib) which holds all frontend-related files.
## Demonstration
1. Take a look at this guided demonstration, presenting the iOS version: [Youtube](amazon.de)  
2. Play around with the web version yourseld: [bet.jakob-landbrecht.com](https://bet.jakob-landbrecht.com)
   
You can adjust the score of the upcoming game by invoking this URL:
```
https://updatevalue-csjycr6t2q-uc.a.run.app/?score={ScoreInteger}&isHomeTeam={true/false}&tournamentId=zXbeHbpMG4a5DPb8jgwT
```
## Conclusion
I invested a long time in this project and in retrospect, there are multiple issues I would like to improve on. Firstly, the overall structure of the code. I did not stick to the correct variable notation recommended by Dart and opted for Camelcase. This also results in an inconsistent naming convention for the names of some entries in the database. Secondly, decoupling. Even though my project is fairly well structured, I would now create a unique cloud Function for every single database request (except the ones requiring real-time updates). This would make it easier to replace the Database and to handle incorrect requests.
